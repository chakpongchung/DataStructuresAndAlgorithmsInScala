/** *

  * Day 11
  *
  * @todo Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
  *       According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
  * @example Example:
  *          Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
  *          Output: 3
  *          Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
  *          received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
  *          Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
  *          two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
  * @note If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
  * @see https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/august-leetcoding-challenge/550/week-2-august-8th-august-14th/3420/
