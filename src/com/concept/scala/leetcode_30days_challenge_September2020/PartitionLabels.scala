/** **
  *
  * Day 4
  *
  * @todo A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
  * @example Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
  *          Output: [9,7,8]
  *          Explanation:
  *          The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
  *          This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
  *          A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
  * @see https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/september-leetcoding-challenge/554/week-1-september-1st-september-7th/3448/
  *      OR
